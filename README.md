Requirements:

- A user-friendly interface where users can add new tasks with a title, description, due date, and priority level (low, medium, high).
- Users should be able to update the status of tasks (to-do, in-progress, completed) and also edit or delete tasks.
- The application should display tasks in a list view, with the ability to sort tasks by due date, priority, or status.
- The application should be responsive and work well on both desktop and mobile devices.Implement a feature to export the tasks to a CSV file.
- There should be a history log showing all the changes made to each task (like when it was created, status changes, edits, etc.)

Development requirements:

- The application must be created using the latest version of Angular.
- You must implement state management via an [ngrx](https://v8.ngrx.io/guide/store) store.
- For data persistence, you can use local storage.
- The application must be hosted for evaluation. Un-hosted applications will have a higher chance of rejection.
